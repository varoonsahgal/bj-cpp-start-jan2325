# Setup
Compile and run the blackjack application.  If you are not familiar with the rules of Blackjack, you can run the game and select option 4 to see details on how to play.

# Long functions in Game class.

For each function that you consider to be Long, make a note as to why it's long (what makes it long?). Do not make any code changes at this time (it's tempting, I know!), just write down which methods are long and why.

Consider:

* Nesting/indentation: nested if and for blocks
* Mixed levels of abstraction: detailed/low-level code combined with method calls
* Doing too many different things: are there blank lines separating them?
* Easy to understand and comprehend at a glance?

After the lab is over, you'll be asked to share what you found, so type your notes in a convenient place.
