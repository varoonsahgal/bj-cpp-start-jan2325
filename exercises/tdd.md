### **TDD Challenge: Checking for Blackjack! 🃏✨**

For this exercise, you're going to use **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** to add a new feature to your blackjack game: **checking for Blackjack**. Follow these steps carefully and remember to write your tests before any code! 🚀

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Feature 🧠**
- Blackjack happens when a hand totals **21 points** with exactly two cards.
- Examples:
  - 🂡 + 🂪 = Blackjack! ✅
  - 🂡 + 🂤 + 🂸 = Not a Blackjack. ❌

---

### **Step 2: Create a New Test Case 🎯**
- Open your `blackjack_test.cpp` file.
- Add a new test case for checking if a hand is a Blackjack. Name it something fun, like `HandTest_ChecksForBlackjack`.
- **Think:** What inputs and outputs will your test need?

---

### **Step 3: Start with a Failing Test 🚨**
- Write a test that creates a hand (e.g., Ace + King) and checks if it’s detected as a Blackjack.
- Use assertions like `EXPECT_TRUE` and `EXPECT_FALSE` to verify behavior.
- 🛑 Don’t write the `isBlackjack` method yet! Let the test guide you.

---

### **Step 4: Add More Tests 🧪**
- Write tests for edge cases:
  - A hand with more than two cards (e.g., Ace + 5 + 5).
  - A hand with a total of 21 but not two cards (e.g., 7 + 7 + 7).
  - A hand with just one card (e.g., Ace).
- Use **descriptive names** for your tests so future-you knows exactly what they’re checking.

---

### **Step 5: Write Just Enough Code 🛠️**
- Implement a simple `isBlackjack` method in your `Player` or `Hand` class that takes two cards.
- Write only the minimum code to make your test pass. No extra functionality yet!

---

### **Step 6: Refactor & Expand 🚧**
- Once your first test passes, **refactor** the `isBlackjack` method for clarity or efficiency.
- Add more tests to cover:
  - Different combinations of face cards and numbers.
  - Handling invalid input (e.g., no cards or null objects).

---

### **Step 7: Integrate with the Game 🃏**
- Add the `isBlackjack` method to the gameplay flow.
- Think: When does the game need to check for Blackjack? At the start of a round? After dealing cards?

---

### **Step 8: Test Again! 🧹**
- Run all your tests to ensure everything still works.
- 💡 Tip: If a test fails, fix the issue before moving on.

---

### **Step 9: Add a Fun Twist! 🎉**
- Optional: Display a fun message when a Blackjack is detected.
  - Example: “🎉 Blackjack! You win this round!” or “🔥 Dealer hits Blackjack!”

---

### **Step 10: Share Your Victory! 🏆**
- Share your tests and new feature with your classmates or teammates.
- Bonus Challenge: Can you think of other edge cases for Blackjack?

---

### **Remember!**
- Keep your tests **clear** and **specific**. Tests are your safety net!
- Embrace TDD: Red (fail) → Green (pass) → Refactor 🔄.
- Have fun coding your way to Blackjack glory! 🌟🃏
